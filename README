As an exercise in dynamic programming, I decided to write this script which take a (phone) number 
and produces a list of possible words based on the standard phone keypads.
I haven't researched the different kinds of keypads. I am just going with what my android shows me.

It does produce duplicates, and does not check for validity in the english language


To use it:
python convert.py {number} {length of word}

Example:
python convert.py 2222222 3

will produce different size 3 sets from {a,b,c} like
aaa,aba,aca, ... etc..
